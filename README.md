# Wilson Lab Schematics

This repository contains shared schematic resources for the Wilson Lab. These files are intended for internal lab use and collaboration, ensuring consistent and high-quality visuals across presentations, posters, and publications.

## Contents

- **Illustrator Files (.ai)**  
  Vector-based schematic templates and components created in Adobe Illustrator for easy editing and reuse.

## Usage

All members of the Wilson Lab are encouraged to:
- Use these schematics in their scientific figures.
- Create variants of these schematics to fit their needs.

However, please avoid altering core existing schematics (e.g., fonts, arrow styles, or colors). If you do make edits to an existing schematic and would like to share them with the lab, please upload as a separate file.

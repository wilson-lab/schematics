# Wilson Lab Schematics

This repository contains shared schematic resources for the Wilson Lab. These files are intended for internal lab use and collaboration, ensuring consistent and high-quality visuals across presentations, posters, and publications.

## Usage

All members of the Wilson Lab are encouraged to:
